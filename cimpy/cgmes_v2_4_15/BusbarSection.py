class BusbarSection(Connector):
	'''
	A conductor, or group of conductors, with negligible impedance, that serve to connect other conducting equipment within a single substation.  Voltage measurements are typically obtained from VoltageTransformers that are connected to busbar sections. A bus bar section may have many physical terminals but for analysis is modelled with exactly one logical terminal.

	:ipMax: Maximum allowable peak short-circuit current of busbar (Ipmax in the IEC 60909-0).  Mechanical limit of the busbar in the substation itself. Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909 Default: 0.0
