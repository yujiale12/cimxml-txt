class EquivalentBranch(EquivalentEquipment):
	'''
	The class represents equivalent branches.

	:r: Positive sequence series resistance of the reduced branch. Default: 0.0
	:r21: Resistance from terminal sequence 2 to terminal sequence 1 .Used for steady state power flow. This attribute is optional and represent unbalanced network such as off-nominal phase shifter. If only EquivalentBranch.r is given, then EquivalentBranch.r21 is assumed equal to EquivalentBranch.r. Usage rule : EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange. Default: 0.0
	:x: Positive sequence series reactance of the reduced branch. Default: 0.0
	:x21: Reactance from terminal sequence 2 to terminal sequence 1 .Used for steady state power flow. This attribute is optional and represent unbalanced network such as off-nominal phase shifter. If only EquivalentBranch.x is given, then EquivalentBranch.x21 is assumed equal to EquivalentBranch.x. Usage rule : EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange. Default: 0.0
	:negativeR12: Negative sequence series resistance from terminal sequence  1 to terminal sequence 2. Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909 EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange Default: 0.0
	:negativeR21: Negative sequence series resistance from terminal sequence 2 to terminal sequence 1. Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909 EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange Default: 0.0
	:negativeX12: Negative sequence series reactance from terminal sequence  1 to terminal sequence 2. Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909 Usage : EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange Default: 0.0
	:negativeX21: Negative sequence series reactance from terminal sequence 2 to terminal sequence 1. Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909. Usage: EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange Default: 0.0
	:positiveR12: Positive sequence series resistance from terminal sequence  1 to terminal sequence 2 . Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909.  EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange. Default: 0.0
	:positiveR21: Positive sequence series resistance from terminal sequence 2 to terminal sequence 1. Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909 EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange Default: 0.0
	:positiveX12: Positive sequence series reactance from terminal sequence  1 to terminal sequence 2. Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909 Usage : EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange Default: 0.0
	:positiveX21: Positive sequence series reactance from terminal sequence 2 to terminal sequence 1. Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909 Usage : EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange Default: 0.0
	:zeroR12: Zero sequence series resistance from terminal sequence  1 to terminal sequence 2. Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909 EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange Default: 0.0
	:zeroR21: Zero sequence series resistance from terminal sequence  2 to terminal sequence 1. Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909 Usage : EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange Default: 0.0
	:zeroX12: Zero sequence series reactance from terminal sequence  1 to terminal sequence 2. Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909 Usage : EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange Default: 0.0
	:zeroX21: Zero sequence series reactance from terminal sequence 2 to terminal sequence 1. Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909 Usage : EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange Default: 0.0
