class BusNameMarker(IdentifiedObject):
	'''
	Used to apply user standard names to topology buses. Typically used for "bus/branch" case generation. Associated with one or more terminals that are normally connected with the bus name.    The associated terminals are normally connected by non-retained switches. For a ring bus station configuration, all busbar terminals in the ring are typically associated.   For a breaker and a half scheme, both busbars would normally be associated.  For a ring bus, all busbars would normally be associated.  For a "straight" busbar configuration, normally only the main terminal at the busbar would be associated.

	:priority: Priority of bus name marker for use as topology bus name.  Use 0 for don t care.  Use 1 for highest priority.  Use 2 as priority is less than 1 and so on. Default: 0
	:ReportingGroup: The bus name markers that belong to this reporting group. Default: None
	:Terminal: The terminals associated with this bus name marker. Default: "list"
